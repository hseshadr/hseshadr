# Harish Seshadri

I build open-source software for decisions where "trust me" isn't good enough — the software
has to show its work. The computation runs **on your own device, in your browser**; data
doesn't leave it, and results can carry a cryptographic receipt anyone can check later.
Everything below is **100% free to use and live today**, and all published source is MIT-licensed.

- **Open-source hub:** [open-source.gainratio.com](https://open-source.gainratio.com/)
- **Advisory & architecture:** [gainratio.com](https://gainratio.com/)
- **GitHub organization:** [github.com/gainratio](https://github.com/gainratio)

## Why

Software increasingly makes calls that affect real people: whether a payment looks suspicious,
what your private text reveals, what you're shown next. Most of it runs on someone else's
server, where you can't see the data it used or check the answer it gave. I think those
decisions should be **inspectable** (the code is open), **private** (your data stays with
you), and **repeatable** (same input, same answer, every time). So each project here moves
the computation into your browser and makes the result something you can verify — not
something you have to take on faith.

### Under the hood (source)

- [gainratio](https://github.com/gainratio) — the organization hosting all public source repositories, shared Dagger CI modules ([gainratio/ci](https://github.com/gainratio/ci)), and release workflows.

## How I build

- **Runs in your browser.** The interesting computation happens on your device; your data doesn't leave it.
- **Deterministic.** Same input, same answer, every time — no hidden randomness in the core engines.
- **Verifiable.** Data ships signed and is checked before use; results can carry signed receipts that can be audited later, offline.
- **Honest about limits.** Every project states what it can't promise as plainly as what it can.
- **Tested before shipped.** Behavior is pinned by automated tests that run on every change, including cross-language compatibility suites.
- **Reproducible from clone.** Each repo has a quickstart that takes you from `git clone` to working output.
